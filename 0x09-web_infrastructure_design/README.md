- This project designs a basic infrastructure to serve a website from a single server.
- Components:
  - Web Server: NGINX

  - Database: MySQL
  - Domain: www.foobar.com â†’ 8.8.8.8 via A record

## Key Points Covered

- DNS: A record maps www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8
- NGINX handles HTTP requests
- App server runs business logic
- MySQL stores data
- Everything runs on a single server (8.8.8.8)

## Limitations

- SPOF
- Maintenance downtime
- No scalability
